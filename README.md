# i-see-you

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jacopor00ta/iseeyou/_apis/build/status/r00ta.i-see-you?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/jacopor00ta/iseeyou/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Install a camera on your car, calculate safety distance from cars and detect dangerous situations, see your data on a dashboard. 

Given that i-see-you would not be fair if the driver would not learn anything, you can install a monitor in your car and see if you are keeping the safety distance between you and the car in front of you.

The version 1.0 would be ready when: 

1) the module can process images and measure what is the distance between the car and the car in front of. 
2) display the distance on the screen and show if the driver is keeping the safety distance. 
3) upload the data somewhere for data collection and debugging for a dashboard?

iseeyou makes drivers more conscious.
